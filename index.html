        <h1>Linux and me</h1>
        <p>I am a Linux hobbyist. I found out about Linux when I was going to ITT Tech.  I ended up dual-booting Ubuntu on my laptop. I have been using Linux ever since. I have used Debian/Ubuntu (distros based on both of them), Fedora, and OpenSuse. Arch (and derivatives). I found Debian-based distros have older packages which ended up being annoying. So, I moved to Fedora. I was using Fedora for a while. Well, when I was not distro-hopping. I tried and failed to install Arch too many times to count and finally got it to work. Honestly, I preferred Arch Anywhere (anarchy) because I could just get Arch up and running without typing tons of commands. Arch Anywhere was an Arch Linux installer os. Nowadays I use Manjaro because of the same reason. Plus I find it doesn't break as much as Arch does but mostly having the AUR just right there. Sure I can install things from the AUR on any Linux distro by compiling it or installing binaries from a .deb or .rpm file. I could just compile from the AUR.  I don't see the point in it beyond because I can. I am happy with Manjaro. And honestly, I don't feel like distro hopping. When most of the distros are Debian/Ubuntu and even if it's not Linux it's more or less the same under the hood. The main difference I find is just the packaging manager and if you don't like it, then you can change that too.  
        I can use Vim well enough to get the task done. I may not know everything about the Bash shell but I feel comfortable. For my desktop, I use both i3wm and Gnome depending on what I am doing.</p>
